# ArduinoSNA
Scalar Network Analyzer implemented using Arduino dev. boards for as cheap as possible.

## Components

### RF detectors
For RF detectors are used AD8318 Logarithmic detectors available from [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1PC-New-Arrival-1-8000MHz-AD8318-RF-Logarithmic-Detector-70dB-RSSI-Measurement-Power-Meter-Module-Board/32821714582.html). Manufacturer documentation is available [online](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad8318.pdf). 
- Detector performance has been initialy verified to be to within 0.1 V using available equipment. Verification was evaluated using sensor characteristic given on Fig. 2 of the Documentation. Actual performance may differ. 

## Implementation
Schematic of the network analyzer is in /sch directory.
